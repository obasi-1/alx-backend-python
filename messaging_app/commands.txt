This file contains the commands to set up and apply the Ingress configuration.

1. Install the Nginx Ingress controller addon in Minikube.

This command enables the controller, which watches for Ingress resources

and configures the Nginx proxy accordingly.
minikube addons enable ingress

2. Apply the Ingress resource configuration from the YAML file.

This command tells the Kubernetes API to create the Ingress resource defined

in ingress.yaml. The Ingress controller will then detect this new resource
and set up the routing rule.
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
